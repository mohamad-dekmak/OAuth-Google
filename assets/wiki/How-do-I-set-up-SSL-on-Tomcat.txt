Option 2 (perfect):


1) Generate the keystore file that will store the certificates trusted by the Tomcat server. Depending on your needs this step may require invoking different commands. A general HowTo regarding the keytool tool usage can be found here.

In my case the keystore file was already delivered to me by my CA when requesting the certificate. However having both the CA and the CA-signed certificate you can easily create the keystore file by running the following commands:

keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias root
-file [CA cert path] -keystore /etc/tomcat7/keystore.jks

keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias tomcat
-file [CA-signed cert path] -keystore /etc/tomcat7/keystore.jks

Or to generate the self-signed certificate:

keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat
-keystore /etc/tomcat7/keystore.jks -storepass keystore
-validity 360 -keysize 2048

Is CN=smb215 smb215, OU=smb215, O=smb215, L=sbm215, ST=smb215, C=lb correct?
  [no]:  yes

Enter key password for <tomcat>
	(RETURN if same as keystore password):  keystore
Re-enter new password: keystore


2) Update /etc/tomcat7/server.xml configuration file and change the following part of its configuration:

<!--
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
           clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
 -->

to what's shown below:

<Connector protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
           port="8443" SSLEnabled="true" maxThreads="200"
           scheme="https" secure="true"
           keystoreFile="/etc/tomcat7/keystore.jks"
           keystorePass="keystore" clientAuth="false"
           sslProtocol="TLS" />

3) As a root user restart Tomcat by running the following command:

sudo service tomcat7 restart

You're done! The Tomcat is now secured with SSL / TLS on port 8443.
